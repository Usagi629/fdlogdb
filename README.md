# fdlogdb
Field Day logging Database Web Application

Not even close to being usable yet, just a project I am working on

Please see files/FDLDB_proposal.pdf for an outline of the project

To run and display content, install a web server application such as XAMMP and place all files into xammp/htdocs.

Alternatively you can install Apache, PHP, and MySQL individually.

When you first install it please run /admin/db-config.php to setup the database tables and make an admin account
